# Instructions for Set-Up

There are 3 python packages to install before use. These can be installed using the 'pip' command in the command line. The packages are as follows:
- PyGithub
- tweepy
- textblob

Once installed. You need to obtain your own api keys/ tokens for each api. These are simple, just sign up and follow the set up instructions on the websites.
Once obtained you need to put them in the correct places in the code. These are marked clearly for you. Do not upload these, as people can steal them. Keep them hidden, keep them safe.

Now your ready to run my code! 'main.py' is the main code for data collection and the other files relate to the web application.

But if you are feeling adventorous you can change the locations or any setting. Go on, take a step of faith.
